This project, GRADUSP, is a comprehensive mobile academic assistant built specifically for students at the University of SÃ£o Paulo (USP). Its primary goal is to help students organize their complex academic lives by consolidating their schedules, course information, and grades into a single, easy-to-use application. The app is designed as a native Android tool, leveraging modern technologies to provide a reactive and robust user experience, replacing the need to manually check multiple university systems.

The core functionality revolves around a powerful calendar and data synchronization system. Users can view their schedule in daily, weekly, or monthly formats and add custom events. The app's key feature is its ability to parse data directly from USP's official JupiterWeb system, allowing students to import their registered lectures (disciplinas), complete with classroom details, schedules, and teacher information, directly into their calendar. Additionally, it includes a grade calculator where students can track their performance by inputting grades and weights for various assessments to see their final calculated grade for each course.

Technically, the application is built using a modern Android tech stack, featuring Kotlin and Jetpack Compose for the entire UI. It follows the MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel) architecture, ensuring a clean separation between the user interface and the underlying business logic and data sources. State management is handled reactively using StateFlow within ViewModels (like CalendarViewModel and SettingsViewModel), and dependencies are managed cleanly through Hilt. Data is cached locally using Android's DataStore and file storage, providing offline access and improving performance by reducing redundant network requests.

**Development Guidelines:**
- When creating Composables, always include a `@Preview` annotation to facilitate UI development and testing.
